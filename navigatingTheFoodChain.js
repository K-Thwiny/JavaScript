/*
 * Use a series of ternary operator to set the category to one of the following:
 *   - "herbivore" if an animal eats plants
 *   - "carnivore" if an animal eats animals
 *   - "omnivore" if an animal eats plants and animals
 *   - undefined if an animal doesn't eat plants or animals
 *
 * Notes
 *   - use the variables `eatsPlants` and `eatsAnimals` in your ternary expressions
 *   - `if` statements aren't allowed ;-)

// change the values of `eatsPlants` and `eatsAnimals` to test your code
var eatsPlants = true;

var category = (eatsAnimals && eatsPlants) ? "omnivore" : (eatsAnimals && !eatsPlants) ? "carnivore" : (eatsPlants && !eatsAnimals) ? "herbivore" : "undefined";
